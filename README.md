# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot with ROS2 and TurtleBot3

## Description

This project focuses on the development of an obstacle avoidance robot using ROS2 (Humble) and the TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi model. The system leverages key robotics components such as sensors, control, and actuators to enable the robot to autonomously navigate through an environment while avoiding obstacles.

The robot uses LiDAR and LaserScan sensors to detect obstacles and measure distances. The data gathered by the sensors is processed by a control system, which employs algorithms to make real-time decisions about the robot's movement. The control system then sends commands to the actuators (wheels and motors) to adjust the robot's position, ensuring it avoids obstacles and moves smoothly.

This project aims to demonstrate the interaction between sensors, control algorithms, and actuators, showcasing how these components work together to achieve autonomous behavior.
